# Agrilyst-The-Crop-Advisor

Abstract<br />
India is the second largest population country in the world and majority of people in India have agriculture as their occupation. Farmers are growing same crops repeatedly without trying new variety of crops and they are applying fertilizers in random quantity without the knowing the required content and quantity. So, this directly affects the crop yield and causes the soil acidification and damages the top layer. This system would suggest the best suitable crop to grow on the land and fertilizers to use, based on soil contents and weather parameters. Hence, by utilizing this system, farmers can cultivate a new variety of crops, which may increase their profit margin and can avoid soil pollution.


Introduction<br />
Agriculture is one of the most important occupation practiced in India. <br />
Prior crop prediction and fertilizer recommendation was performed based on farmers’ experience on a particular location. They tend to prefer the prior or neighborhood or more trend crop in the surrounding region only for their land and they don’t have enough of knowledge about soil nutrients content such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium in their own land. <br />
Due to this, it leads to reduction in the crop production and increase in soil pollution (soil acidification) which further damages the top layer.


Proposed solution<br />
Recommending the best crop to grow and fertilizers to use using Machine Learning.<br />
Crop Prediction System - Providing various inputs such as soil data, rainfall, temperature, location, etc. to predict the best possible crop to grow on a given land.<br />
Fertilizer Recommendation System - Providing inputs such as soil data and the type of crop would recommend fertilizers (if required) to improve the yield of the crop (mostly organic).

Performance of the project<br />
The web application uses Random Forest algorithm which has an accuracy of 99.09%.<br />
While executing the goals that we had proposed, we analyzed all the existing systems and concluded that all other systems were short on accessibility, accuracy, efficiency and compatibility compared to this system which has multiple features clubbed together with a very intuitive interface.<br />
This web application is easy to use with its simple interface and gives unmatched accuracy.<br />
We were able to successfully execute all that we had proposed ,with our system performance at par with our proposed system.

Conclusion<br />
Farmers generally use hit and trial method which leads to wastage of land and resources or even disproportionate growth of crops. Our system would provide the right track to the farmers by recommending them crops and fertilizers. This would help them improve their crop production quantitatively and qualitatively and  maintain the quality and nutrition contents of the soil for further reuse.
